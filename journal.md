## Week 1: Making the game

### Day 1

Today I worked on importing the Flynn character model from Skylanders Giants, getting him cleaned up and setting him up inside the game. To set him up, I began programming the player and camera movement, the player can move in all 4 directions and should be pretty easy to swap over to joystick controls once I've created the controller. The player smoothly rotates in the direction that they're walking and the camera can orbit around the player's body. However, it currently orbits their feet so tomorrow I'll try to move it up so that the camera orbits around the player's head instead. I also quickly added jumping but I want to tweak the speed at which they fall back down because right now the player feels quite floaty.
